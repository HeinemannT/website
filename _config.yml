description: >- # Customize this!
  A personal space for musings on literature, life's reflections.
url: "https://HeinemannT.github.io" # Your GitHub Pages root URL
baseurl: "/website" # CRITICAL: Your repository name, as it's a project site

# Hyde Theme Specific Settings (from Hyde's defaults, customize as needed)
hyde:
  theme_color: theme-base-0d # Example: theme-base-0d (blue), theme-base-08 (red). See Hyde docs for options.
  reverse_layout: false      # Set to true to put sidebar on the right

# Build settings
markdown: kramdown
kramdown:
  input: GFM # Enables GitHub Flavored Markdown
  hard_wrap: false
highlighter: rouge
permalink: pretty # Makes URLs like /categories/name/ instead of .html
# relative_permalinks: true # This is true by default in Jekyll 3, can often be omitted

# Pagination (Optional, if your Hyde index.html supports it and you want it)
# paginate: 5
# paginate_path: "/website/page:num/" # Ensure baseurl is included if you enable pagination

# Navigation links for the Hyde sidebar
# Adjust titles and URLs as needed.
# URLs should be relative to your site root AFTER baseurl is applied.
# Example: if a page is at /website/about/, the url here is /about/
# Jekyll prepends the baseurl automatically for {{ nav_item.url | relative_url }} in templates
nav:
  - title: Home
    url: / # Points to HeinemannT.github.io/website/
  - title: About
    url: /about/ # Assumes you have about.md with permalink: /about/
  - title: Archives # Example - you'll need to create an archive.md page for this
    url: /archives/
  # - title: My Book List # Example
  #   url: /book-list/ # You would create book-list.md

# Custom Variables (from Hyde's example, version of Hyde theme)
version: 2.1.0 # Or remove if not needed

# GitHub repository (optional, for links if the theme uses it)
# github:
#   repo: https://github.com/HeinemannT/website # Link to your site's repo

  - Gemfile
  - Gemfile.lock
  - Rakefile
  - README.md # Good to keep your project's README.md separate from site content

  - .jekyll-cache/
