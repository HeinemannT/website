# Theme
theme: jekyll-theme-minimal # A clean, simple theme to start with. Others: jekyll-theme-merlot, jekyll-theme-cayman

# Navigation - some themes might use this, others generate nav from pages.
# This is an example if your theme supports it this way.
# For jekyll-theme-minimal, it tends to pick up top-level pages automatically.
# We can refine navigation later based on how your chosen theme works.
