Two projects I don't take credit for. It is scary how well AI - in this case Gemini 2.5 Pro - manages to transform coarse words and concepts into a detailed reality.


[A tracker for my studies]({{ '/study-tracker/' | relative_url }}) - I am pursuing SCRUM and ISO 27001 certifications. Of course, procrastination always precedes studying, so I channeled it into creating this small site.

[AI Act questionnaire]({{ '/ai-act-questionnaire/' | relative_url }}) - The AI act is a confusing piece of legislation on several different levels. This site is an attempt to dispell confusion on the most surface level and determine an AI system's risk classification.

I find webpages fascinating. I love sleek, creative sites with a purpose.
But creating one myself with HTML? That's too much effort. I know Java, C#, JavaScript, and Python, not to mention some WordPress, but the HTML and CSS process is too overwhelming.
However, webpages provide you with something tangible â€” a working artifact that is shareable and visually iterable.
