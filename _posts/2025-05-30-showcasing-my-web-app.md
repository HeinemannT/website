## Check Out My Latest Project!

I'm excited to share a small web application I've been working on. It's a neat experiment featuring a web manifest and a service worker for some offline capabilities.

You can explore the project directly here:

[Launch My Cool Project]({{ '/study-tracker/' | relative_url }})

I built this to explore [mention a technology or concept if you like, e.g., Progressive Web App features, vanilla JS, etc.]. 
Let me know what you think if you get a chance to check it out!

### Technical Bits:
* It uses a `manifest.json` for app-like properties.
* A `sw.js` service worker is included for [mention its purpose, e.g., caching assets].
