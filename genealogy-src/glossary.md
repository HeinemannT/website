This expanded glossary provides a deeper understanding of the **Xiaolao Village Lineage Record**, focusing on the non-linear structure of the document and the specific "scientific" interests of the ancestors regarding the earth.

### I. Format & Chronology: Navigating the "Jump"
A Chinese genealogy is rarely a simple linear timeline from start to finish. If you notice the dates jump from 1955 (Img 20) back to the 1400s (Img 23), you are encountering the **Branch System**.

*   **Reading Direction:** Text flows in vertical columns from **top to bottom**, and the columns move from **right to left**. 
*   **The "Reset" (Branch Logic):** The book is organized by **Branches (Fang 房)**. The scribe follows one specific family line (e.g., the eldest son's descendants) all the way to the present day. Once that line is exhausted, the book "resets" hundreds of years back to pick up the lineage of the *second* son, following his descendants to the present. 
*   **Tai-tou (抬頭 - The "Raised" Text):** When a column begins one or two spaces higher than others, the scribe is "bowing" to an ancestor or a high imperial title. It creates a visual hierarchy of importance on the page.
*   **Supplemental Pages:** Some pages (like those with "占" or "壹" in the margins) are later additions or specific dossiers for land deeds. These are often tucked into the back of a branch's record regardless of chronological order.

### II. Cultural Context: The Science of the Soil
One of the most striking features of this record is the obsessive detail regarding **Sediment and Soil** (e.g., "five inches of black sand," "rouge-red earth"). This was not a geological survey; it was **Geomancy (Feng Shui)**.

*   **The Mountain as a Living Body:** In Cantonese tradition, a mountain is viewed as a "Dragon." The rocks are the bones, and the soil is the "flesh." 
*   **Qi (Life Energy) Indicators:** The color and texture of the earth were proof that the grave was "plugged in" to the dragon's energy. 
    *   **Rouge-Red Earth (胭脂紅土):** Highly prized. This vibrant color indicated "living" earth that would nourish the ancestor’s spirit and, by extension, the family’s wealth.
    *   **Layered Sand:** Specific layers of yellow or black sand acted as "filters" for the energy, ensuring it was clean and potent.
*   **Precision as Protection:** The dimensions of the grave (down to the inch) and the soil descriptions served as a **forensic record**. If a rival clan tried to move the grave or build over it, the family could prove the original "purity" of the site using this book as legal evidence.

### III. Key Recurring Terms

#### 1. Naming & Identity
*   **Generation Poem (Pai-hang 排行):** A 20 or 40-character poem where each character represents a generation. This allowed two strangers from the same clan to meet and instantly know who was the "uncle" and who was the "nephew" based on their middle names.
*   **Courtesy Name (Zi 字) vs. Pseudonym (Hao 號):** A man’s official name was often kept private. Peers used the *Zi*, while the *Hao* was a self-selected "brand" that reflected his literary or spiritual aspirations.

#### 2. Adoption & Continuity
*   **Si (嗣 - Adoption):** Because a man without a son was a spiritual disaster (leaving no one to feed his ghost), the clan would "install" a nephew as his heir. This was a formal legal act recorded here to ensure property remained within the branch.
*   **Wei-回 (Unreturned):** You will see notes about men who went to **Singapore (Nanyang)** or **Guangxi** and "never returned." These are tragic markers of the Cantonese diaspora.

#### 3. Status & Rank
*   **Jinshi (進士):** The "Ph.D." of the era. A man who passed the highest Imperial Exams and became a national leader.
*   **Feng-zeng (封贈 - Posthumous Honors):** If a grandson became a famous general, the Emperor would "send back" titles to his dead father. This is why a simple village farmer might be listed here with the rank of a high official.

#### 4. The Ritual of Death
*   **Jin-ta (金塔 - Golden Pagoda):** A ceramic urn. In the South, bodies were buried for 7–10 years, then exhumed. The bones were cleaned and placed in these urns for a "Final Burial" in a more auspicious Feng Shui location.
*   **Zuo/Xiang (坐/向):** The "Sit" and "Face" of a tomb. A "North-Sitting, South-Facing" grave was the ultimate goal for maximizing family prosperity.
