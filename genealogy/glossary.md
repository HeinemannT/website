### I. Format & Chronology: Navigating the "Jump"

*   **Reading Direction:** Text flows in vertical columns from **top to bottom**, and the columns move from **right to left**. 
*   **Tai-tou (抬頭 - The "Raised" Text):** When a column begins one or two spaces higher than others, the scribe is "bowing" to an ancestor or a high imperial title. It creates a visual hierarchy of importance on the page.
*   **Marginalia:** Some pages carry marginalia, notes (like "占" or "壹") to the right of the text to indicate the order.

### II. Cultural Context: The Science of the Soil
One of the recurring features of this record is the detail regarding **Sediment and Soil** (e.g., "five inches of black sand," "rouge-red earth"). This was about **Geomancy (Feng Shui)**.

*   A mountain is viewed as a "Dragon." The rocks are the bones, and the soil is the "flesh." 
*   The color and texture of the earth were proof that the grave was "plugged in" to the dragon's energy. 
*   Rouge-Red Earth (胭脂紅土) was highly prized. This vibrant color indicated "living" earth that would nourish the ancestor’s spirit and, by extension, the family’s wealth.
*   Layered Sand: Specific layers of yellow or black sand acted as "filters" for the energy, ensuring it was clean and potent.
*   The dimensions of the grave (down to the inch) and the soil descriptions served as a forensic record. If a rival clan tried to move the grave or build over it, the family could prove the original "purity" of the site using this book as legal evidence.


### III. Key Recurring Terms

#### 1. Naming & Identity
*   **Generation Poem (Pai-hang 排行):** A 20 or 40-character poem where each character represents a generation. This allowed two strangers from the same clan to meet and instantly know who was the "uncle" and who was the "nephew" based on their middle names.
*   **Courtesy Name (Zi 字) vs. Pseudonym (Hao 號):** A man’s official name was often kept private. Peers used the *Zi*, while the *Hao* was a self-selected "brand" that reflected his literary or spiritual aspirations.

#### 2. Adoption & Continuity
*   **Si (嗣 - Adoption):** Because a man without a son was a spiritual disaster (leaving no one to feed his ghost), the clan would "install" a nephew as his heir. This was a formal legal act recorded here to ensure property remained within the branch.
*   **Wei-回 (Unreturned):** You will see notes about men who went to Singapore (Nanyang) or Guangxi and "never returned." These are markers of the  diaspora.

#### 3. Status & Rank
*   **Jinshi (進士):** The "Ph.D." of the era. A man who passed the highest Imperial Exams and became a national leader.
*   **Feng-zeng (封贈 - Posthumous Honors):** If a grandson became a famous general, the Emperor would "send back" titles to his dead father.

#### 4. The Ritual of Death
*   **Jin-ta (金塔 - Golden Pagoda):** A ceramic urn. In the South, bodies were buried for 7–10 years, then exhumed. The bones were cleaned and placed in these urns for a "Final Burial" in a more auspicious Feng Shui location.
*   **Zuo/Xiang (坐/向):** The "Sit" and "Face" of a tomb. A "North-Sitting, South-Facing" grave was the goal for maximizing family prosperity.
